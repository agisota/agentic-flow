Agentic Flow runs Claude Code agents at near zero cost without rewriting a thing. It routes every task to the cheapest lane that still meets the bar. Local ONNX when privacy or price wins. OpenRouter for breadth. Gemini for speed. Anthropic when quality matters most. One agent. Any model. Lowest viable cost.

Agentic Flow works with any agent or command built or used in Claude Code. It automatically runs through the Claude Agent SDK, forming swarms of intelligent, cost and performance-optimized agents that decide how to execute each task. Built for business, government, and commercial use where cost, traceability, and reliability matter.

The system takes the Claude SDK's logic and merges it with Claude Flow memory to give every agent a durable brain. Each run logs inputs, outputs, and route decisions with artifacts, manifests, and checksums for proof and reproducibility. It self-optimizes in real time, balancing price, latency, and accuracy through a simple policy file.

Strict mode keeps sensitive data offline. Economy mode prefers ONNX or OpenRouter. Premium mode goes Anthropic first. The policy defines the rules, and the swarm enforces them automatically.

It runs anywhere: local for dev, Docker for CI, or Flow Nexus for scale. With project-scoped settings, explicit tool allowlists, and an offline privacy lane, it stays secure by default.

**Agentic Flow is the framework for autonomous efficiency—one unified runner for every Claude Code agent, self-tuning, self-routing, and built for real-world deployment.**

Built on **[Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk)** by Anthropic, powered by **[Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)** (101 MCP tools), **[Flow Nexus](https://github.com/ruvnet/flow-nexus)** (96 cloud tools), **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)** (100+ LLM models), **Google Gemini** (fast, cost-effective inference), **[Agentic Payments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-payments)** (payment authorization), and **ONNX Runtime** (free local CPU or GPU inference).

## Why Agentic Flow?

**The Problem:** You need agents that actually complete tasks, not chatbots that need constant supervision. Long-running workflows - migrating codebases, generating documentation, analyzing datasets - shouldn't require you to sit there clicking "continue."

**What True Agentic Systems Need:**
- **Autonomy** - Agents that plan, execute, and recover from errors without hand-holding
- **Persistence** - Tasks that run for hours, even when you're offline
- **Collaboration** - Multiple agents coordinating on complex work
- **Tool Access** - Real capabilities: file systems, APIs, databases, not just text generation
- **Cost Control** - Run cheap models for grunt work, expensive ones only when needed

**What You Get:**

- **150+ Specialized Agents** - Researcher, coder, reviewer, tester, architect - each with domain expertise and tool access
- **Multi-Agent Swarms** - Deploy 3, 10, or 100 agents that collaborate via shared memory to complete complex projects
- **Long-Running Tasks** - Agents persist through hours-long operations: full codebase refactors, comprehensive audits, dataset processing
- **213 MCP Tools** - Agents have real capabilities: GitHub operations, neural network training, workflow automation, memory persistence
- **Auto Model Optimization** - `--optimize` flag intelligently selects best model for each task. DeepSeek R1 costs 85% less than Claude with similar quality. Save $2,400/month on 100 daily reviews.
- **Deploy Anywhere** - Same agentic capabilities locally, in Docker/Kubernetes, or cloud sandboxes

**Real Agentic Use Cases:**
- **Overnight Code Migration** - Deploy a swarm to migrate a 50K line codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript while you sleep
- **Continuous Security Audits** - Agents monitor repos, analyze PRs, and flag vulnerabilities 24/7
- **Automated API Development** - One agent designs schema, another implements endpoints, a third writes tests - all coordinated
- **Data Pipeline Processing** - Agents process TBs of data across distributed sandboxes, checkpoint progress, and recover from failures

> **True autonomy at commodity prices.** Your agents work independently on long-running tasks, coordinate when needed, and cost pennies per hour instead of dollars.

## 🎯 Model Optimization (NEW!)

**Automatically select the optimal model for any agent and task**, balancing quality, cost, and speed based on your priorities.

### Why Model Optimization?

Different tasks need different models:
- **Production code** → Claude Sonnet 4.5 (highest quality)
- **Code reviews** → DeepSeek R1 (85% cheaper, nearly same quality)
- **Simple functions** → Llama 3.1 8B (99% cheaper)
- **Privacy-critical** → ONNX Phi-4 (free, local, offline)

**The optimizer analyzes your agent type + task complexity and recommends the best model automatically.**

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Let the optimizer choose (balanced quality vs cost)
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Build REST API" --optimize

# Optimize for lowest cost
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Simple function" --optimize --priority cost

# Optimize for highest quality
npx agentic-flow --agent reviewer --task "Security audit" --optimize --priority quality

# Optimize for speed
npx agentic-flow --agent researcher --task "Quick analysis" --optimize --priority speed

# Set maximum budget ($0.001 per task)
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Code cleanup" --optimize --max-cost 0.001
```

### Optimization Priorities

- **`quality`** (70% quality, 20% speed, 10% cost) - Best results, production code
- **`balanced`** (40% quality, 40% cost, 20% speed) - Default, good mix
- **`cost`** (70% cost, 20% quality, 10% speed) - Cheapest, development/testing
- **`speed`** (70% speed, 20% quality, 10% cost) - Fastest responses
- **`privacy`** - Local-only models (ONNX), zero cloud API calls

### Model Tier Examples

The optimizer chooses from 10+ models across 5 tiers:

**Tier 1: Flagship** (premium quality)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 - $3/$15 per 1M tokens
- GPT-4o - $2.50/$10 per 1M tokens
- Gemini 2.5 Pro - $0.00/$2.00 per 1M tokens

**Tier 2: Cost-Effective** (2025 breakthrough models)
- **DeepSeek R1** - $0.55/$2.19 per 1M tokens (85% cheaper, flagship quality)
- **DeepSeek Chat V3** - $0.14/$0.28 per 1M tokens (98% cheaper)

**Tier 3: Balanced**
- Gemini 2.5 Flash - $0.07/$0.30 per 1M tokens (fastest)
- Llama 3.3 70B - $0.30/$0.30 per 1M tokens (open-source)

**Tier 4: Budget**
- Llama 3.1 8B - $0.055/$0.055 per 1M tokens (ultra-low cost)

**Tier 5: Local/Privacy**
- **ONNX Phi-4** - FREE (offline, private, no API)

### Agent-Specific Recommendations

The optimizer knows what each agent needs:

```bash
# Coder agent → prefers high quality (min 85/100)
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Production API" --optimize
# → Selects: DeepSeek R1 (quality 90, cost 85)

# Researcher agent → flexible, can use cheaper models
npx agentic-flow --agent researcher --task "Trend analysis" --optimize --priority cost
# → Selects: Gemini 2.5 Flash (quality 78, cost 98)

# Reviewer agent → needs reasoning (min 85/100)
npx agentic-flow --agent reviewer --task "Security review" --optimize
# → Selects: DeepSeek R1 (quality 90, reasoning-optimized)

# Tester agent → simple tasks, use budget models
npx agentic-flow --agent tester --task "Unit tests" --optimize --priority cost
# → Selects: Llama 3.1 8B (cost 95)
```

### Cost Savings Examples

**Without Optimization** (always using Claude Sonnet 4.5):
- 100 code reviews/day × $0.08 each = **$8/day = $240/month**

**With Optimization** (DeepSeek R1 for reviews):
- 100 code reviews/day × $0.012 each = **$1.20/day = $36/month**
- **Savings: $204/month (85% reduction)**

## 🎛️ Using the Multi-Model Router

### Quick Start with Router

```javascript
import { ModelRouter } from 'agentic-flow/router';

// Initialize router (auto-loads configuration)
const router = new ModelRouter();

// Use default provider (Anthropic)
const response = await router.chat({
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Your prompt here' }]
});

console.log(response.content[0].text);
console.log(`Cost: $${response.metadata.cost}`);
```

  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
      "models": { "default": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" }
    },
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-...",
      "baseUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "models": { "default": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet" }
    },
    "onnx": {
      "modelPath": "./models/phi-4/.../model.onnx",
      "executionProviders": ["cpu"],
      "localInference": true
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenRouter Integration (99% Cost Savings)

Access 100+ LLM models through OpenRouter for dramatic cost savings while maintaining full functionality:

```bash
# Set OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# Use any OpenRouter model (proxy auto-starts)
npx agentic-flow \
  --agent coder \
  --task "Build REST API" \
  --model "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

# Or force OpenRouter mode
export USE_OPENROUTER=true
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Build REST API"
```

**Popular OpenRouter Models:**
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` - 99% cost savings, excellent coding
- `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1` - Superior code generation at 97% savings
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025` - Fastest responses, 95% savings
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` - Full Claude via OpenRouter

**Cost Comparison:**
| Provider | Model | Input (1K tokens) | Output (1K tokens) | Savings |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Anthropic Direct | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $0.003 | $0.015 | Baseline |
| OpenRouter | Llama 3.1 8B | $0.00003 | $0.00006 | **99%** |
| OpenRouter | DeepSeek V3.1 | $0.00014 | $0.00028 | **97%** |
| OpenRouter | Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.000075 | $0.0003 | **95%** |

**How It Works:**
1. Detects OpenRouter model (contains "/") or USE_OPENROUTER=true
2. Auto-starts integrated proxy server on port 3000
3. Translates Anthropic Messages API ↔ OpenAI Chat Completions API
4. Claude Agent SDK transparently uses OpenRouter via ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL
5. Full MCP tool support (all 203 tools work)

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Required for OpenRouter
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# Optional configuration
export USE_OPENROUTER=true              # Force OpenRouter usage
export COMPLETION_MODEL=meta-llama/...  # Default OpenRouter model
export PROXY_PORT=3000                  # Proxy server port
```

### Google Gemini Integration (Speed & Cost Optimization)

Access Google's Gemini models for fast, cost-effective inference with native integration:

```bash
# Set Gemini API key
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxx

# Use Gemini directly (no proxy needed)
npx agentic-flow \
  --agent coder \
  --task "Build REST API" \
  --provider gemini \
  --model "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"

# Or force Gemini mode
export USE_GEMINI=true
npx agentic-flow --agent researcher --task "Analyze trends"
```

**Available Gemini Models:**
- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` - Experimental, fast responses, free up to rate limits
- `gemini-2.5-flash` - Production-ready, 95% cost savings vs Claude
- `gemini-2.5-pro` - Premium quality with competitive pricing

**Cost Comparison (Gemini vs Others):**
| Provider | Model | Input (1M tokens) | Output (1M tokens) | Savings vs Claude |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $3.00 | $15.00 | Baseline |
| Google | Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp | **FREE** | **FREE** | **100%** (up to limits) |
| Google | Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.075 | $0.30 | **98%** |
| Google | Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 | $5.00 | **70%** |

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Latency**: Gemini 2.5 Flash is fastest (avg 1.5s for 500 tokens)
- **Quality**: Gemini 2.5 Pro comparable to Claude Sonnet 3.5
- **Streaming**: Full support for real-time output
- **MCP Tools**: All 213 tools work seamlessly

**How It Works:**
1. Detects `--provider gemini` or `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Uses native Gemini API (no proxy needed, unlike OpenRouter)
3. Automatic message format conversion (Anthropic → Gemini)
4. Full MCP tool support (all 213 tools work)
5. Cost tracking and usage metrics built-in

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Required for Gemini
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxx

# Optional configuration
export USE_GEMINI=true          # Force Gemini usage
export PROVIDER=gemini          # Set default provider
```

**Use Cases Where Gemini Excels:**
- ✅ **Speed-critical tasks** - Fastest inference of all cloud providers
- ✅ **Prototyping** - Free tier excellent for development
- ✅ **High-volume workloads** - 98% cost savings at scale
- ✅ **Real-time applications** - Low latency streaming responses
- ✅ **Cost-conscious production** - Balance quality and price

**Programmatic Usage:**
```javascript
import { ModelRouter } from 'agentic-flow/router';

const router = new ModelRouter();

// Direct Gemini usage
const response = await router.chat({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this code...' }],
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 2048
});

console.log(response.content[0].text);
console.log(`Provider: ${response.metadata.provider}`);  // "gemini"
console.log(`Cost: $${response.metadata.cost}`);         // ~$0.0003 per request
console.log(`Latency: ${response.metadata.latency}ms`);  // ~1200ms avg
```

### Free ONNX Local Inference

Run agents with **zero API costs** using local ONNX models:

```javascript
// CPU Inference (6 tokens/sec, 100% free)
const router = new ModelRouter();
const onnxProvider = router.providers.get('onnx');

const response = await onnxProvider.chat({
  model: 'phi-4',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this sensitive data...' }],
  maxTokens: 100
});

console.log(response.content[0].text);
console.log(`Cost: $${response.metadata.cost}`);  // $0.00
console.log(`Latency: ${response.metadata.latency}ms`);
console.log(`Privacy: 100% local processing`);
```

### Privacy-Based Routing

Automatically route privacy-sensitive workloads to free local ONNX inference:

```javascript
// Configure privacy routing in router.config.json
{
  "routing": {
    "mode": "rule-based",
    "rules": [
      {
        "condition": { "privacy": "high", "localOnly": true },
        "action": { "provider": "onnx" },
        "reason": "Privacy-sensitive tasks use free ONNX local models"
      }
    ]
  }
}

// Router automatically uses ONNX for privacy workloads
const response = await router.chat({
  model: 'any-model',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Process medical records...' }],
  metadata: { privacy: 'high', localOnly: true }
});

// Routed to ONNX automatically (zero cost, 100% local)
console.log(response.metadata.provider);  // "onnx-local"
```

### GPU Acceleration

Enable GPU acceleration for 10-50x performance boost:

```json
// router.config.json
{
  "providers": {
    "onnx": {
      "executionProviders": ["cuda"],  // or ["dml"] for Windows
      "gpuAcceleration": true,
      "modelPath": "./models/phi-4/...",
      "maxTokens": 100
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance Comparison:**
- CPU: 6 tokens/sec (free)
- GPU (CUDA): 60-300 tokens/sec (free)
- Cloud API: Variable (costs $0.002-0.003/request)

### Zero-Cost Agent Execution

Run agents entirely offline with local ONNX models:

```bash
# Use ONNX provider for free inference
npx agentic-flow \
  --agent researcher \
  --task "Analyze this privacy-sensitive data" \
  --provider onnx \
  --local-only

# Result: $0.00 cost, 100% local processing
```

### Cost Comparison

| Workload Type | Provider | Cost per Request | Privacy | Performance |
|---------------|----------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Privacy-Sensitive** | ONNX (CPU) | **$0.00** | 100% local | 6 tokens/sec |
| **Privacy-Sensitive** | ONNX (GPU) | **$0.00** | 100% local | 60-300 tokens/sec |
| **Complex Reasoning** | Anthropic Claude | $0.003 | Cloud | Fast |
| **General Tasks** | OpenRouter | $0.002 | Cloud | Variable |

**Example Monthly Costs (1000 requests/day):**
- 100% ONNX: **$0** (free local inference)
- 50% ONNX, 50% cloud: **$30-45** (50% savings)
- 100% cloud APIs: **$60-90**

## 🔧 MCP Tools (213 Total)

Agentic Flow integrates with **four MCP servers** providing 213 tools total:

### Direct MCP Access

You can now directly manage MCP servers via the CLI:

```bash
# Start all MCP servers
npx agentic-flow mcp start

# List all 213 available tools
npx agentic-flow mcp list

# Check server status
npx agentic-flow mcp status

# Start specific server
npx agentic-flow mcp start claude-flow
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Automatic** (Recommended): Agents automatically access all 213 tools when you run tasks

## 📦 Advanced Deployment Patterns

### ☁️ Flow Nexus Cloud Sandboxes (Scalable Production)

**Best for cloud-native, auto-scaling workloads:**

```javascript
// Full-featured agent execution in isolated E2B sandboxes
import { flowNexus } from 'flow-nexus';

// Setup: One-time authentication
await flowNexus.login({
  email: process.env.FLOW_NEXUS_EMAIL,
  password: process.env.FLOW_NEXUS_PASSWORD
});

// Deploy: Create sandbox and execute
async function deployAgent(task) {
  // 1. Create isolated sandbox
  const sandbox = await flowNexus.sandboxCreate({
    template: 'node', // or 'python', 'react', 'nextjs'
    name: `agent-${Date.now()}`,
    env_vars: {
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    },
    install_packages: ['@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'],
    timeout: 3600 // 1 hour max
  });

  // 2. Execute agent with ALL 203 MCP tools
  const result = await flowNexus.sandboxExecute({
    sandbox_id: sandbox.id,
    code: `
      const { query } = require('@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk');
      const result = await query({
        prompt: "${task}",
        options: {
          permissionMode: 'bypassPermissions',
          mcpServers: {
            'claude-flow-sdk': /* 6 tools */,
            'claude-flow': /* 101 tools */,
            'flow-nexus': /* 96 tools */
          }
        }
      });
      console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
    `,
    language: 'javascript',
    capture_output: true
  });

  // 3. Cleanup (automatic after timeout)
  await flowNexus.sandboxDelete({ sandbox_id: sandbox.id });

  return result;
}
```

**Why Flow Nexus is Recommended:**
- ✅ **Full MCP Support**: All 203 tools work (subprocess servers supported)
- ✅ **Persistent Memory**: Claude Flow memory persists across sandboxes
- ✅ **Security**: Complete process isolation per sandbox
- ✅ **Multi-Language**: Node.js, Python, React, Next.js templates
- ✅ **Real-Time**: Live output streaming and monitoring
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: Pay per use (10 credits/hour ≈ $1/hour)

**Flow Nexus Pricing:**
| Resource | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Sandbox (hourly) | 10 credits | ≈ $1/hour per sandbox |
| Storage | 1 credit/GB/month | Files and environment data |
| Credits Package | $10 = 100 credits | 10+ hours of sandbox time |

## 📊 Architecture

### Ephemeral Agent Lifecycle

```
1. REQUEST → Agent definition loaded from YAML
2. SPAWN → Agent initialized with system prompt + tools
3. EXECUTE → Task processed using Claude SDK + MCP tools
4. STREAM → Real-time output (optional)
5. COMPLETE → Result returned to caller
6. TERMINATE → Agent process exits, memory released
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Cold Start**: <2s (includes MCP server initialization)
- **Warm Start**: <500ms (MCP servers cached)
- **Memory Usage**: 100-200MB per agent
- **Concurrent Agents**: Limited only by host resources

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Researcher │────▶│   Memory    │◀────│ Code Review │
│   Agent     │     │   Storage   │     │   Agent     │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │    Data     │
                    │   Analyst   │
                    └─────────────┘
```

**Coordination via:**
- Shared memory (in-process or external)
- Claude Flow MCP tools
- File system (for batch jobs)
- Message queues (for async workflows)

const result = await query({
  prompt: 'Analyze AI trends',
  options: {
    systemPrompt: agent.systemPrompt,
    permissionMode: 'bypassPermissions'
  }
});

console.log(result.output);
```

### Flow Nexus Integration

Requires registration for cloud features:

```bash
# Register account
npx agentic-flow --agent flow-nexus-auth \
  --task "Register with email: user@example.com"

# Login
npx agentic-flow --agent flow-nexus-auth \
  --task "Login with email: user@example.com, password: ***"

# Create cloud sandbox
npx agentic-flow --agent flow-nexus-sandbox \
  --task "Create Node.js sandbox and execute: console.log('Hello')"
```

## 📈 Performance & Scaling

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Cold Start** | <2s (including MCP initialization) |
| **Warm Start** | <500ms (cached MCP servers) |
| **Agent Spawn** | 75 agents loaded in <2s |
| **Tool Discovery** | 203 tools accessible in <1s |
| **Memory Footprint** | 100-200MB per agent process |
| **Concurrent Agents** | 10+ on t3.small, 100+ on c6a.xlarge |
| **Token Efficiency** | 32% reduction via swarm coordination |

### Cost Analysis - ONNX vs Cloud APIs

| Provider | Model | Tokens/sec | Cost per 1M tokens | Monthly (100K tasks) |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| ONNX Local | Phi-4 | 6-300 | $0 | $0 |
| OpenRouter | Llama 3.1 8B | API | $0.06 | $6 |
| OpenRouter | DeepSeek | API | $0.14 | $14 |
| Claude | Sonnet 3.5 | API | $3.00 | $300 |

**ONNX Savings:** Up to $3,600/year for typical development workloads
