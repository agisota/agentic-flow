## ⚡ TL;DR (30 seconds)

**Question:** Why do 75% of learning methods show ZERO amplification?

**Answer:** Because resistance doesn't help their goals!

**Examples:**
- Q-Learning: Resistance → Task → Reward ✅ (AMPLIFIES)
- Cooperative: Resistance → Team harm ❌ (DOESN'T AMPLIFY)
- Imitation: Resistance → Diverges from expert ❌ (DOESN'T AMPLIFY)
- Curiosity: Resistance → Boring ❌ (REDUCES!)

**Practical:** Use one of 6 safe methods OR apply one of 7 fixes
