# AI and Machine Learning Concepts

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information.

## Training Process

Training involves feeding data through the network, computing errors, and adjusting weights using backpropagation to minimize loss.

## Applications

- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Understanding
- Speech Recognition
- Autonomous Systems
- Recommendation Systems

## Best Practices

1. Use proper data preprocessing
2. Implement regularization to prevent overfitting
3. Monitor validation metrics during training
4. Use appropriate learning rates
5. Consider computational resources
